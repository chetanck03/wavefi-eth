# 🚀 WaveFi

> A skill-based competitive gaming platform built on Monad chain where players can earn real rewards through mini-games.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Traditional casual gaming platforms like Winzo and MPL are entertaining but lack real-world incentives and true ownership. They do not leverage blockchain’s capabilities for decentralization, transparency, or monetization.
Players are increasingly seeking skill-based games that offer crypto rewards, support asset ownership via NFTs, and run with low latency. However, most Web3 games are slow, expensive, and overly complex to onboard.

WaveFi solves this by building a fast, on-chain gaming platform on the Monad blockchain where players can:

- Play skill-based games (starting with a Flappy Bird clone)
- Earn real crypto for their performance
- Enjoy a fun and fair ecosystem

It also introduces an AI-powered Trick Mode for added challenge and replayability. This Web3-native approach creates a new era of play-to-earn that’s fun, fast, and truly decentralized.

## 🎯 Objective

WaveFi is a blockchain-powered play-to-earn gaming platform built on **Monad**, designed to deliver competitive skill-based gaming experiences. Players convert Monad tokens into platform points to enter game rooms, compete in mini-games, and win real rewards. Inspired by platforms like MPL and Winzo, our platform enables users to compete in simple yet engaging games with entry fees, creating prize pools where winners earn real value in Monad tokens.
